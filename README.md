 This is a script used for cleaning the data from NYC's Local Law 87 energy 
   efficiency report filings.  It is our hope that by sharing this script, 
   the community of energy geeks who is analyzing this data can coalesce upon 
   a single methodology for data cleaning, so that all analysis of the data 
   starts from the same point.  We are sharing this under the Mozilla Public 
   License 2.0 to ensure that any modifications that anyone chooses to make to 
   this cleaning script will similarly be shared with the public.

 The input data file 'LL87 2013+2014 Energy Audit Data.xlsx', is created by 
   appending the city's LL87 data from 2013 and 2014.
